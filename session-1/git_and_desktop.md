### What is Git and GitHub?


#### From the desktop app

1. Once you're on the start screen, click "Create a New Repository on your hard drive...".
2. Fill in the fields with the information about your new repository. (I'd suggest checking the "Initialize this repository with a README" box).
3. Click "Create Repository".
4. If it's all working correctly, you'll have a button within the program to "publish repository". Click this, and it'll make sure your repository is registered with GitHub.
5. Open up VSCode (or your IDE of choice) and open the folder for your new repository.
6. Open the only file in the folder, called README.md. This file is typically used to describe the project, any instructions to make it run, etc. In this tutorial we're just going to change it a little.
7. In README.md, delete everything (should only be one line), and write your name inside. Then make sure to save it.
8. Once the README.md file has been saved, once again go back to GitHub Desktop and you'll be shown what's been removed and added to the file. Make sure you're happy, because nothing has been saved on GitHub yet.
9. When you're happy, click on the text bar that says "Update README.md". Type in "Wrote my name".  
   This line is a quick description of the commit, or a summary of what's been changed.
10. Click the "Commit to Main" button, then the "Push Origin" button within the program.
11. Head back to the GitHub website and take a look at your new repository, from here you should be able to see your name.
